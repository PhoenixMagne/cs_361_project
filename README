<Accessing and modifying instructions>

just like the other assignments in cs290 you can just 
git clone <ssh key>
in the terminal and make a clone of the project. 

IMPORTANT: everyone should pull the latest changes from the repo before making
any changes to make sure there are no conflicts

When making changes, try to only change small things and then make a
commit w/ a good comment saying what you did. example:

git add <files you changed, could be "*" to add all files>
git commit -m "added a new feature that does xyz"
git push origin main

if you get an error saying "failed to push some refs because of non fast-forward"
then that means that someone else has made changes to the repo since you last pulled.
in this case, do a 
git pull origin main
and then repeat the steps above after resolving any merge conflicts.

doing this regularly will help make sure that we don't have a lot of merge conflicts
when multiple people are working on the same files.

<TODO list>
